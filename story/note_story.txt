Story: Editing text

As a note-taker
I want to use familiar editing shortcuts
So that I can save time

Scenario: Cut and paste
  Given a new document
  When I type "pineapple"
  And I cut all the text
  Then the text should be empty
  
  When I type "mango"
  And I select all the text
  And I paste the clipboard contents
  Then the text should equal "pineapple"

Story: minimalist invites
  As a host with lots to do
  I want to plan a party with a minimum of mouse clicks
  So that I can get on with the rest of my tasks
  
  Scenario: email-free invites
    Given a party called "Party at Joe's house"
    Then I should see the Web address to send to my friends
    And the party should begin on Saturday at 10 PM
    And the party should end on Sunday at 2 AM

This directory contains the code examples from the "Telling a Good Story" chapter.  Since the release of the book, the RSpec Story Runner has been supplanted by the Cucumber tool.

The Story Runner examples are now in Cucumber format.  You'll find the stories themselves in the "features" directory, with the supporting code in "features/step_definitions" and "features/support."  To run them, do the following:

1) Make sure you're running the latest RSpec (still used for fancy "should" matching), Cucumber, and supporting libraries:
      sudo gem install cucumber rspec Selenium chronic
2) Run the features:
      cucumber -n features

The password example from the chapter was intended just for illustration.  Since there's no point in updating it to run with Cucumber, I've moved it into the "old" directory.
